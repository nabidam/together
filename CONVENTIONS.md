# CONVENTIONS.md — Together

Living document. Applies to the V2 codebase (ephemeral rooms + local playback). Where this file and `ARCHITECTURE.md` disagree, ARCHITECTURE wins; fix the loser in the same commit.

## Naming

### Go
- Packages: single lowercase word (`db`, `auth`, `live`, `media`). No new packages without a spec change.
- Exported `CamelCase`, unexported `camelCase`. No `Get` prefixes (`hub.Room(id)`, not `hub.GetRoom(id)`).
- Files: lowercase, fewest files wins; split only past ~500 lines.
- Tests: `_test.go` beside the code. Names `TestSubject_Behavior` (`TestJoin_ReconnectKeepsName`).

### JavaScript / Svelte
- Components `PascalCase.svelte` in `web/src/components/`; routed views in `web/src/pages/`; shadcn-generated primitives in `web/src/components/ui/` (vendor — reskin via tokens, don't hand-edit logic).
- `web/src/lib/`: lowercase `.js`, pure logic only — DOM belongs in components.
- Svelte 5 runes exclusively (`$state`, `$derived`, `$effect`). No legacy `$:`, no stores unless runes can't express it.
- Tests: `<name>.test.js` beside the lib, plain `node --test`.

### Wire protocol
- Frame `type` strings: lowercase, `snake_case` when multiword, exactly as `ARCHITECTURE.md` §4.5 (`hello`, `presence`, `chat`, `activity`, `intent`, `status`, `room_closed`, `pong`, `error`, `start`, `end`, `ping`). Enum values likewise (`file_ready`, `in_sync`).
- JSON fields: `camelCase` (`roomId`, `sizeBytes`, `isGuest`, `createdAt`).
- Field names are hand-matched between `internal/live/hub.go` and `web/src/lib/ws.js` — no codegen. Change both sides in the same commit, always.
- Time units: `pong.serverTime` is unix **milliseconds**; chat `createdAt` is unix **seconds**. Never mix.

## Error handling

### Go
- Wrap with context at each boundary: `fmt.Errorf("join room %s: %w", id, err)`. Lowercase messages, no trailing punctuation.
- HTTP: correct status + `{"error": "human-readable message"}` — the one error shape everywhere. Never leak paths or stack traces. Join-token probes get an undifferentiated 404 (no live-room oracle).
- Security boundaries are server-enforced: first boot requires a non-empty admin user and a password of at least 12 Unicode code points; failed login/register requests use bounded per-IP token buckets; a loopback proxy alone may supply `X-Forwarded-For`. Keep `429` JSON errors paired with integer `Retry-After`.
- Externally controlled collections and bodies need an explicit server budget. Live rooms cap connections at 12, owners at 10 rooms, and the process at 100 rooms. Upload creation JSON caps at 4 KiB, chunks at 8 MiB, subtitles at 10 MiB; declared totals and `Upload-Length` are checked before writes. Oversize bodies are `413`; offset, total, and incomplete-upload failures are `409`.
- WebSocket: recoverable client mistakes → `error` frame, connection stays open. Repeated protocol violations → close that connection only.
- Panics: none in request paths by design, but every goroutine touching a room carries the per-room `recover()` (log with room id → tear down that room → process keeps serving). This is load-bearing (NFR-7) — never remove it.
- Logging: stdlib `log.Printf`, one line per event, `key=value` tail: `log.Printf("room closed id=%s reason=%s", id, reason)`. No framework, no levels.

### JavaScript
- `ws.js` never throws into components: it exposes connection state and dispatches typed messages; failures surface as UI states (reconnect banner, inline errors), not exceptions.
- While disconnected, intents and chat are visibly disabled — never silently swallowed (AC-3.6).
- Size mismatch and acquisition failures are inline states of the panel, never modals, and never auto-fall-back to streaming (FR-13).

## Folder rules

- `cmd/server/` — main, env config, mux wiring, embedded `webdist/`. No business logic.
- `internal/db/` — schema DDL + boot cutover only. Imports nothing internal.
- `internal/auth/` — accounts, argon2id, account sessions, invite codes, `Require` middleware.
- `internal/live/` — the room world: `watch.go` (pure: no I/O, no clock ownership — caller passes `now`), `hub.go` (rooms map, WS, broadcast, chat ring, timers), `rooms.go` (lifecycle, guest sessions, `RequireRoom`). **Only this package touches room state**; nothing else may hold a pointer into a room.
- `internal/media/` — upload, pipeline, serve. **Only `pipeline.go` invokes ffmpeg/ffprobe**, one job at a time, `nice -n 19`, ingest only — never live.
- New top-level directories require a spec change. Default answer is no.
- Dependency budget (binding): `go.mod` = exactly `github.com/coder/websocket`, `modernc.org/sqlite`, `golang.org/x/crypto`. `web/package.json` = the existing Svelte 5/Vite/Tailwind v4 toolchain + `lucide-svelte` + fontsource + `shadcn-svelte` and its transitive requirements (accepted V2 ceiling — nothing else rides in with it).

## Test style

- Go: stdlib `testing` only — no testify, no mock frameworks. Table-driven where cases enumerate. Integration tests run the real stack: `httptest.Server` + real `websocket.Dial` + real SQLite in `t.TempDir()` + real ffmpeg fixtures via `-f lavfi` synthesis (skip if ffmpeg missing).
- Time: inject durations (`TOGETHER_ROOM_IDLE`, struct fields with defaults) — never `time.Sleep`-and-hope. `go test ./... -race` must pass.
- Frontend: only pure lib logic is unit-tested (`node --test`, zero frameworks): `sync.js`, `localfile.js`. Component behavior = `npm run build` + manual two-browser checks logged in `.superpowers/sdd/progress.md`.
- The sync state machine (`internal/live/watch.go` ↔ `web/src/lib/sync.js`) keeps mirrored suites — changing one side without both suites updated is an incomplete change.
- Every non-trivial branch (validation, auth gates, limits, suffixing) has a test that fails if the logic breaks.
- `scripts/security-e2e.sh` is the production-composition regression journey. It owns its disposable data directory, must clean up on success, signal, and `TOGETHER_E2E_INJECT_FAILURE=1`, and never uses production credentials or data. `verify.sh` runs it when ffmpeg and ffprobe are available; otherwise it prints the explicit skip and the release gate still runs it.

## Commit style

- Conventional prefixes: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `chore:`. Imperative, lowercase after prefix, ≤72-char subject.
- One commit per `specs/001-core/PLAN.md` chunk; each commit builds, tests green, `gofmt -l internal cmd` empty.
- **Before every commit after a frontend build:** `git restore cmd/server/webdist/index.html` (committed-placeholder hazard — has bitten multiple times).
- Deliberate shortcuts carry `// ponytail: <ceiling + upgrade path>` in code, not in the commit message. Read existing ponytail comments before "fixing" the simplicity they document.

## UI

- All styling values come from `design.md` (NxCode) via `@theme` in `web/src/app.css`; `DESIGN.md` is the adoption map for shadcn-svelte. No raw hex, px font sizes, or ad-hoc radii in components. Dark only. Inter + JetBrains Mono. Lucide icons; no emoji in UI chrome; sentence case everywhere.
- A11y floors: contrast ≥4.5:1, cyan (secondary token) focus rings, ≥44px touch targets, body ≥15px, `prefers-reduced-motion` respected.
